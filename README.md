## General Info
This repository contains the two projects, each of which includes it own README detailing how it was implemented:

- Omniwheels_controller- This is an implementation of the velocity controller that was ran on the three-wheel omniwheeled robot.

- Formation_coordination_uav_ugv- This contains a implementation of the formation and coordination algorithm in simulation(MATLAB) and in the real robot(ROS, C++).
