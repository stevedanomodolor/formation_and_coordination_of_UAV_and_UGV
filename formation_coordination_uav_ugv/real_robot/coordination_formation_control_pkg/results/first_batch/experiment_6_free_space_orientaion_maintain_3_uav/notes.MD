# Goal
- Maintain the current centroid
- X: 0
- Y: 0
- Vx: 0
- Vy: 0
- Orientation 0

Experiment premises
Formation control of 3 crazyflies center at 0,0 position and 0,0 velocity with orientation.The same paramters as

# comment on the results obtained during test
Uses Paramters as expriment 4, we are using the current velocity to integrate the acceleration as in experiment 4. but with orientation included. Result is bad because of the positioning system in the crazyflie1 drone. It kepps oscilating alot.
