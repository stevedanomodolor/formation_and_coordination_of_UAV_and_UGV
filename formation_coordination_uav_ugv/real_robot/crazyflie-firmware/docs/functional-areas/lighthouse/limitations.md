One limitation of the lighthouse deck is that since the deck only has horizontal sensors, the angle at which the base-stations are seen cannot be too shallow. This means that you should fly at least 40cm bellow the base-stations and that the base-stations should be placed above the flight space.

## State of the base station V2 support

The lighthouse V2 support is currently at a Minimum Viable Product state.
This means that is it well supported but still has some limitation that can be lifted in future development.

* 1 and 2 base stations are supported
* The base stations must be configured to use channel 1 and 2
