# Use this script to make an app, mainly intended for the toolbelt
#
# The scipt taks one requierd argument, which is the path to the app to build (must be in the source tree)
# Optional aguments can be added that will be passed on to make.
#
# "tb make_app <path/to/app>" behaves as calling "make" in the directory where the app is located, meaning that any
# arguments for make can just be appended.
#
# Eamples:
# tb make_app examples/app_hello_world -j8
# tb make_app examples/app_hello_world clean
